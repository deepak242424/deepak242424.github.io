# About Me
<div style = "text-align: justify"> I am currently working as an Manchie Learning Engineer at Verisk|AI Hyderabad. I am working in the intersection of Computer Vision and Learning. I am also exploring Semi Supervised Learning methods in Speech Processing. 
 
Previous to that I completed my M.S. (Research) under Dr. Balaraman Ravindran and co-guided by Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai at IIT Madras. My thesis was focused on Model compression and Filter Pruning in Deep Convolutional Neteworks. I also worked on Vehicle Detection in Heterogeneous traffic scenarios.
